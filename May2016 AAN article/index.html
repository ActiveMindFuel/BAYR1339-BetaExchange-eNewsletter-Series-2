							The Betaseron brand team was proud to host physician customers from around the world at the annual American Academy of Neurology congress, 18-21 April in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia. Many global colleagues from Europe, the Middle East and the Americas joined the US brand team to represent Bayer.

					<h1>BETASERON Promotional Booth</h1>
					<p>
						Bold colors, the energetic “Don’t MS around” US campaign and prominent BETACONNECT displays made the Betaseron booth a highlight in the week’s events. Since FDA approval in September 2015, AAN marked the first major event to formally introduce BETACONNECT to U.S. physicians. The Betaseron team noted that interest in the device was high and feedback on its features was overwhelmingly positive. To assist in these 	discussions, a larger-than-life model of the device was on display within the booth, along with several informational video monitors and interactive touchscreens, which incorporated a dynamic 3D-rendering of the autoinjector.
					</p>
					<p>
						Relative to other exhibitor displays, the BETASERON booth had excellent foot traffic and attendance was strong with more than 300 physicians stopping by. Half of recorded visitors came from the US and the balance traveled from around the world, including countries as far away as Hong Kong. These meetings created several leads for the sales force to follow-up with once attendees were back in their home cities.

We look forward to our next major congress, the annual cMSc (Consortium of MS Centers) meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, 1-4 June.

					<h1>KOL Engagement Activities (Mark Rametta)</h1>
					<p>
						Bayer seized AAN as an opportunity to engage industry thought-leaders and patient advocacy groups in discussions surrounding BETASERON, BETACONNECT and current topics in the field of MS.
					</p>
					<p>
						On Monday, 18 April, Bayer held an Advisory Board meeting entitled, Long-Term Studies with BETASERON. Attendees of the event, including 18-top MS experts from multiple academic institutions, convened to discuss topics that centered around:

					<h1>Bayer Supported Posters (Martina)</h1>
					<p>
						Bayer presented the following two posters at this year’s AAN congress.
					</p>
					<p>
						<img style="width: 50%; float: right;" src="imgs/FINAL-2016_AAN_NEDA_(Goodin)_Poster_04-08-16.png" alt="">
						<span class="blue">Evaluation of the NEDA (No Evidence of Disease Activity) measure for predicting long-term outcomes from the pivotal trial of interferon beta-1b in multiple sclerosis (Goodin)</span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Investigating the current hot topic of NEDA (no evidence of disease activity) and potential benefits of evaluating short-term data for long-term usage</span></li>
							<li><span>Data from the original pivotal Betaferon study and the outcomes from the long-term follow-up analyses (16-Year LTF or 21-Year LTF) were utilized for this research</span></li>
							<li><span>The findings of this study:</span><br><br>
								<ul>
									<li><span>Illustrated that clinical NEDA (no relapses; no disability worsening) after 2 years of treatment with Betaferon was associated with better outcomes after 16 years</span></li>
									<li><span>Noted that when MRI parameters were included in the definition of NEDA, NEDA could not predict significantly the disease outcomes</span></li>
									<li><span>Showed that neither definition of NEDA (clinical; clinical + MRI) significantly predicted survival at 21 years, although there were trends for both</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						<img style="width: 50%; float: right;" src="imgs/FINAL-2016_AAN_BEN_11_Regression_(Freedman)_Poster_04-08-16.png" alt="">
						<span class="blue">Baseline predictors of disease activity in patients with CIS treated with interferon beta-1b in the BENEFIT 11 trial (Freedman)</span>
						<ul>
							<li><span>Exploring what early signs of MS can tell us over the long-run</span></li>
							<li><span>The data set from BENEFIT 11 was used for this study</span></li>
							<li><span>A number of demographic, MRI and clinical variables were identified that predicted longer-term disease outcomes. For example:</span><br><br>
								<ul>
									<li><span>Younger patients appeared to have faster conversion to CDMS and higher annualized relapse rate, but a lower risk for EDSS progression</sapn></li>
									<li><span>Females may have been associated with higher relapse activity and likelihood of disease progression</span></li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

							Both posters illustrate Bayer's commitment and utilization of our long-term study data to further substantiate the impact of Betaferon in Multiple Sclerosis.
