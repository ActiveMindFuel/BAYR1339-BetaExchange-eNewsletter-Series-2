						<h1>AAN 2016</h1>
						<p>
							The Betaseron brand team was proud to host physician customers from around the world at the annual American Academy of Neurology congress, 18-21 April in beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia. Many global colleagues from Europe, the Middle East and the Americas joined the US brand team to represent Bayer.

					<h1 style="text-style: italic;">BETASERON Promotional Booth</h1>
					<p>
						Bold colors, the energetic “Don’t MS around” US campaign and prominent BETACONNECT displays made the Betaseron booth a highlight in the week’s events. Since FDA approval in September 2015, AAN marked the first major event to formally introduce BETACONNECT to U.S. physicians. The Betaseron team noted that interest in the device was high and feedback on its features was overwhelmingly positive. To assist in these 	discussions, a larger-than-life model of the device was on display within the booth, along with several informational video monitors and interactive touchscreens, which incorporated a dynamic 3D-rendering of the autoinjector.
					</p>
					<p>
						Relative to other exhibitor displays, the BETASERON booth had excellent foot traffic and attendance was strong with more than 300 physicians stopping by. Half of recorded visitors came from the US and the balance traveled from around the world, including countries as far away as Hong Kong. These meetings created several leads for the sales force to follow-up with once attendees were back in their home cities.

						The US team would like to thank all those involved with preparing and staffing the booth, including Bayer sales consultants and managers, who worked together to make this a great experience for our customers. We look forward to our next major congress, the annual cMSc (Consortium of MS Centers) meeting in National Harbor, Maryland, 1-4 June.
