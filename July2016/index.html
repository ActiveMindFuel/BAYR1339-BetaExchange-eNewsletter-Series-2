		<p>
			<img align="right" src="imgs/Lunch Photo.png" alt="image goes here">The 2-day meeting began with Betaferon nurses from around the world sharing learnings from the BETACONNECT system launch as well as their own patients’ experiences with the autoinjector. The 2nd day included presentations by Australian and US nurses followed by informative workshops centered on new initiatives.
		</p>
		<p>
			After lunch, the nurses were then introduced to Breelib, the new Ventavis nebulizer for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Attendees learned about the nebulizer, remote monitoring project, training materials and the App, which patients can use to track their adherence. The nurses were then able to interact with the different materials and provide feedback to the Ventavis team. After experiencing Breelib, all agreed that the new nebulizer would be a significant improvement for their patients.

			The meeting was considered a win-win for all—not only for sharing best practices and uncovering new insights, but also in saving time and travel costs. Both teams look forward to combining resources again next year.
