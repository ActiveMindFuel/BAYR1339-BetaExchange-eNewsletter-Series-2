<p>
On 11-12 June, the Global Betaferon team hosted a council meeting in Vienna. Approximately 30 advisors traveled from the US, Europe, Latin America and North Africa to participate and provide feedback to Bayer.

In addition to chairing the event, David Bates, Professor of Clinical Neurology at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, summarized data from BENEFIT-11 and to launch a discussion about the various aspects of Betaferon’s long-term benefit-to-risk profile: including general safety considerations, data from pregnancy registration and NEDA (No Evidence of Disease Activity) data.

Differing opinions were revealed in regards to the most valuable data to come from BENEFIT-11. Some advisors felt that classic clinical measures, such as low disease progression, are most appreciated by the MS community while others welcome outcomes focusing on measures such as: cognition, employment, fatigue. Regardless, there is a unanimous belief that the scientific community recognizes the inherent value in further investigating this cohort and urges Bayer to continue investing in these efforts. A recommending by one advisor was to make data available to HCPs for discussing with patients in consulting rooms.

Bayer also welcomed several other presenters on topics including:
•	Douglas Jeffery: Have the roles of various compounds in the MS treatment patterns changed over the past months? 
•	Barry Singer: Vitamin D and MS 
•	Wolfgang Köhler: Adherence in MS and the role of service offerings

The council meeting also provided an opportunity for the advisors to review the competitive MS treatment landscape. In light of moderate efficacy of Biogen’s Daclizumab, many attendees felt that the numerous required safety measures required by the FDA approval would become a hurdle. Group expectations were more positive towards Roche’s Ocrelizumab, but it was clear that both of these therapies would act as 2nd line agents.

First-line agents were also discussed and Tecfidera dominated the conversation with reports of poor tolerability, questions surrounding lymphocyte monitoring and understanding the risk of PML. Attendees also raised the topic of safety risks for patients being prescribed Gilenya. 

Attendees overwhelmingly agreed that Betaferon continues to remain a good option, especially for patients who are concerned about safety.

<span style="font-size:22px; color:#127bbe; font-style:italic;">Workshop Sessions</span>
<p>
To deliberate and examine topics in more depth, attendees were divided into 3 smaller groups, to participate in 2 workshop sessions.

<strong>Workshop #1:  Reviewing the data</strong>
Each of the groups were asked to:
•	Chose data on either Betaferon’s long-term data or vitamin D and MS
•	Create a content outline for a review article 
•	Consider and address multiple aspects, such as: 
	o	What data are more/less important? 
	o	Strengths and limitations of the data 
	o	How do they integrate previously presented data?
The Global team was impressed with the proposals prepared by each of the workshop groups.

<strong>Workshop #2:  Translating key strengths of Betaferon (data and services) into clinical practice</strong>
For this activity, groups discussed and assessed the value of investing in a BENEFIT-15 study and a 25 Year LTF. Attendees expressed that the BENEFIT cohort is a better representation of patients from their everyday practice and possibly a more valuable investment. However, the group undoubtedly agreed that data from either study would be widely appreciated by the scientific community. 

A number of MS experts proposed that a head-to-head comparison (study or data analyses) should be conducted between Betaferon versus Tecfidera and the workshop offered an opportunity to address this proposal. While the discussion was lively, there remains to be a fair amount of controversy surrounding this potential concept.
